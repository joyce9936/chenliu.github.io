### Academic bio

I earned my Master's degree in the [Cognitive & Information Sciences](https://cogsci.ucmerced.edu) program at UC Merced, where I contributed to research in Dr. Zenaida Aguirre-Mu√±oz's [Language,Learning, and Teaching Lab](https://www.languagelearningandteachinglab.org/) and Dr. Rachel Ryskin's [Language, Interaction, & Cognition (LInC) lab](https://linclab0.github.io). Currently, I serve as the lab manager in Dr. Zenaida's lab, continuing my collaboration with both professors. My research focuses on bilingual sentence processing, particularly on how second language learners process sentences. 

I completed my undergraduate studies in Special Education (B.Ed.) at National Tsing Hua University. Moreover, I have a keen interest in how technology can facilitate language learning, with a particular focus on reading education.
